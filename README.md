## ⚡ The Problem

Building a robust, high-load API in Python today forces you to assemble a complex "framework Lego" from dozens of libraries (FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus...). Developers spend countless hours on:

-   **Infrastructure Boilerplate:** Wiring up databases, caches, and message brokers.
-   **Repeating Patterns:** Implementing retry logic, rate limiting, and circuit breakers for every service.
-   **Observability Overhead:** Manually adding logging, metrics, and tracing to every project.
-   **Inconsistent Standards:** Ending up with different setups across services, making maintenance a nightmare.

**Apex** is the opinionated, batteries-included framework that solves this. We provide a hardened foundation with production-ready patterns, so you can focus on what makes your API unique.

## ✨ Features

-   **🚀 High-Performance Routing:** Built on Starlette and Uvicorn for minimal overhead.
-   **🔮 Built-in Observability:** Integrated structured logging (JSON), Prometheus metrics, and OpenTelemetry tracing out of the box.
-   **💾 Smart Data Layer:** A unified async interface for Postgres, Redis, and more with automatic caching and retries.
-   **🛡️ Resilience Patterns:** Built-in rate limiting, circuit breaking, and retry logic for your dependencies.
-   **🤖 Service Client Factory:** Automatically generate typed, resilient clients for your internal APIs from OpenAPI specs.
-   **📦 Project Generator:** Get started instantly with `apex new` – a perfect project structure, Docker config, and CI/CD pipeline.
-   **📚 Comprehensive Docs:** Automatically generated OpenAPI docs, Python clients, and more.
